1. Pods: It contains a Unique IP Address. So that the traffic can distribute in the containers. Can also share the volumes, disk utilizations, Finally the pod management is done through API or delegated through controller.
2. Labels: Clients can manage "Key value pairs". Used for Identification of configuration and management system.
