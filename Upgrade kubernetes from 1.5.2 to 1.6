Updgrade the kubernetes version from 1.5.2 to 1.6

1. Unschedule the Nodes in the Master

--> kubectl cordon <IPaddress>
--> kubectl cordon <$Hostname> 

It should display "Ready,SchedulingDisabled"  

2. Stop the service kubelet in the Slave (Node) by using the command below

	systemctl stop kubelet	

3. Stop the services in the Master only by using the command 

--> At this point, with controller-manager, scheduler, apiserver, and proxy stopped, Kubernetes is shut down.

--> Use the command to shutdown 

	systemctl stop kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kube-proxy
	
 Use the commands I tried before for Example:

	systemctl stop kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kube-proxy
	kubectl get nodes
	systemctl status kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kube-proxy
	systemctl start kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kube-proxy
	clear
	systemctl start kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler etcd

Note : Finally we should get the Nodes status "kubectl get nodes" 

	The status of all nodes should be "NotReady,SchedulingDisabled."


4. Upgrade ETCD.
